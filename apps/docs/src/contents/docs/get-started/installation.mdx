description: Install the Catalix CLI and use the component registry.
---

Catalix ships a CLI that pulls components from a JSON registry and writes them into your project, keeping you in full control of the code. This guide covers installing the CLI, required project setup, and how the registry works.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js** 18+ or later
- **Package manager**: pnpm, npm, or yarn

<Callout>
  ⚠️ This library only supports **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS v4**. It relies
  on the latest utilities introduced in Tailwind v4, so earlier versions are not
  compatible. We also recommend using **TypeScript** for the best developer
  experience, including type safety and auto-completion.
</Callout>

## Pick Your Framework

Currently, **we only support Next.js**. Catalix UI is designed to work with React frameworks in general, but at the moment, only **Next.js** is fully supported.
