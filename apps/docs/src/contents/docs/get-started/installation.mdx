description: Install the Catalix CLI and use the component registry.
---

Catalix ships a CLI that pulls components from a JSON registry and writes them into your project, keeping you in full control of the code. This guide covers installing the CLI, required project setup, and how the registry works.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Package manager**: pnpm, npm, or yarn
- **Tailwind CSS v4** configured in your app (the CLI validates this)
- **TypeScript path alias** configured in `tsconfig.json` (the CLI validates this)

## Install the CLI

You can run the CLI via npx/pnpm dlx without installing, or add it to devDependencies.
