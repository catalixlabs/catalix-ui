description: Install the Catalix CLI and use the component registry.
---

Catalix ships a CLI that pulls components from a JSON registry and writes them into your project, keeping you in full control of the code. This guide covers installing the CLI, required project setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js** 18+ or later
- **Package manager**: pnpm, npm, or yarn

<Callout type="info">
  This library supports only **Tailwind CSS v4**, as it relies on the latest
  utilities from that release. All components are written in **TypeScript**, and
  we strictly recommend using it in your project
</Callout>

## Pick Your Framework

Catalix UI is designed to work with React frameworks in general, but at the moment, only **Next.js** is fully supported.

- **[Next.js](/docs/get-started/installation/next)** A fullstack React framework for building server-side rendered
  applications.
- **[Vite](/docs/get-started/installation/next)** A fullstack React framework for building server-side rendered
  applications.
