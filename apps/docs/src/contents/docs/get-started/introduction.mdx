Catalix UI is an open-source component library designed to make building modern, accessible, and consistent user interfaces effortless. Powered by [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) primitives and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it combines robust accessibility with the flexibility of a utility-first design system. Inspired by the approach of [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com), Catalix UI carries my own twist: a focus on transparency, scalability, and community ownership. Instead of locking developers into opaque, one-size-fits-all components, Catalix UI embraces an open, adaptable structure that encourages customization and contribution. The goal is to provide not just a set of reusable building blocks, but a living foundation that grows with your projects and the community â€” fast to start with, flexible enough to evolve, and open for everyone to shape.
