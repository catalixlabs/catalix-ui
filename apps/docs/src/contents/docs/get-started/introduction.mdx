title: Introduction
description: Open-source, developer-first UI components powered by Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
---

Catalix UI is an open-source library built to make creating modern, accessible, and consistent interfaces effortless.

We stand on the shoulders of giants — leveraging [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for accessible, low-level primitives and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the flexibility of a utility-first design system. Our styling approach is inspired by [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com), but with our own twist.

We believe that developers shouldn’t be locked into rigid, opaque components. Instead, Catalix UI embraces openness, transparency, and adaptability. Every piece is designed to be easy to customize, extend, and contribute to, so your project’s design system can grow alongside your needs.

Our goal is bigger than just offering reusable building blocks: we want to provide a living foundation, shaped and improved by the community. Catalix UI should be fast to start with, flexible enough to evolve, and open for everyone to make their mark.
