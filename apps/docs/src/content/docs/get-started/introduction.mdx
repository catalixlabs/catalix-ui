Catalix UI is a component library built to make creating modern, accessible, and consistent user interfaces effortless. Inspired by the philosophy of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), this project reimagines that same developer-first experience but with my own twist — a focus on flexibility, scalability, and a foundation that grows with me as a developer.

The spark for Catalix UI came from the way shadcn/ui demonstrated that components don’t need to be bloated black boxes. Instead, they can be lightweight, transparent, and developer-owned. That idea resonated deeply with me. I wanted to craft a system that not only makes it faster to spin up UIs but also encourages developers to take full ownership of their codebase, customizing and evolving it however they like.

## Why Catalix?

Catalix UI is designed to give you the best of both worlds:

- **Accessibility out of the box** — built on top of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), every component ships with proven accessibility primitives so you don’t have to reinvent them.
- **Utility-first styling** — styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), making it easy to customize components directly within your design system.
- **Developer ownership** — components live in your codebase, not in a package black box. You can inspect, extend, or rewrite them however you need.
- **Scalable patterns** — the architecture is opinionated enough to save time, but flexible enough to adapt as your product and team grow.

Catalix UI isn’t just about speeding up development — it’s about giving you accessible, consistent, and fully controllable building blocks for your interface.
