Foundry UI is a component library built to make creating modern, accessible, and consistent user interfaces effortless. Inspired by the philosophy of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), this project reimagines that same developer-first experience but with my own twist — a focus on flexibility, scalability, and a foundation that grows with me as a developer.

The spark for Foundry UI came from the way shadcn/ui demonstrated that components don’t need to be bloated black boxes. Instead, they can be lightweight, transparent, and developer-owned. That idea resonated deeply with me. I wanted to craft a system that not only makes it faster to spin up UIs but also encourages developers to take full ownership of their codebase, customizing and evolving it however they like.

## Why Foundry?

A foundry is a place where raw materials are shaped into tools and creations with purpose. That metaphor perfectly captures the spirit of this project: Foundry UI is not just a collection of pre-built components, but a workshop where ideas take form. It’s meant to give you a solid starting point, while leaving plenty of room for creativity, experimentation, and refinement.

My vision with Foundry UI is to deliver a set of opinionated, well-structured components that can save time without limiting creativity. At its core, it aims to promote accessibility, ensure design consistency, and empower developers to build interfaces they’re proud of. More than just a library, Foundry UI is my ongoing workshop — a place where I experiment, refine patterns, and shape a system that evolves alongside modern frontend development.
